            "description":"This Santa Barbara County Super Tuscan red has legitimate Italian roots. Joe Carrari, the 81-year-old son of Italian immigrants, first planted these vineyards decades ago, and later sold his vineyard to Louis \u201cThe Dirtman\u201d Lucas. He used his pruning prowess and extensive knowledge to renovate and revitalize the vineyard, primarily by trellising each varietal differently to enhance the flavors of the grapes. The warm summer days and cool coastal nights of the Los Alamos Valley provide the perfect growing environment, allowing for the production of aromatic, full-flavored wine that maintains varietal character.",
