            "description":"When Irish dairy farmer Lloyd McQueen immigrated to California in the 1930s, he didn\u2019t expect to join the region\u2019s burgeoning wine industry. But he quickly found his niche growing Carignane and Zinfandel grapes in the heart of Suisun Valley. These viticultural roots are strong, as McQueen\u2019s grandson and great-grandson, Howard and Brian Babcock, currently farm his Morrison Lane Vineyard, home to this bold, earthy Petite Sirah.",
